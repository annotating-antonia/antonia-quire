[{"content":"Willa Cather\u0026rsquo;s My Ántonia is as significant at in 2018 as it was 100 years ago at its first publication. It has inspired readers of all stripes to make the pilgrimage to Red Cloud, the small Nebraska town whose memory Cather drew upon in writing about Black Hawk. It has inspired literary scholars to examine not only the text of the novel, but also Cather\u0026rsquo;s relationships with the people of Red Cloud who, in some way, inspired the characters of My Ántonia.\nIn this online project, we invite readers from all backgrounds to participate in annotating the text of My Ántonia. Many of the themes are as relevant today as they were during Cather\u0026rsquo;s lifetime, and we invite annotations exploring such connects alongside those that examine literary and historical context for the novel.\nTo take part in this project, visit the Hypothes.is website and set up an account.

He and I are old friends — we grew up together in the same Nebraska town — and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything. The dust and heat, the burning wind, reminded us of many things. We were talking about what it is like to spend one\u0026rsquo;s childhood in little towns like these, buried in wheat and corn, under stimulating extremes of climate: burning summers when the world lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky, when one is fairly stifled in vegetation, in the color and smell of strong weeds and heavy harvests; blustery winters with little snow, when the whole world is stripped bare and gray as sheet-iron. We agreed that no one who had not grown up in a little prairie town\nix Next Page →\n","id":1,"length":219,"title":"ix","type":"introduction","url":"//localhost:1313/introduction/ix/"},{"content":"could know anything about it. It was a kind of freemasonry, we said.\nAlthough Jim Burden and I both live in New York, and are old friends, I do not see much of him there. He is legal counsel for one of the great Western railways, and is sometimes away from his New York office for weeks together. That is one reason why we do not often meet. Another is that I do not like his wife.\nWhen Jim was still an obscure young lawyer, struggling to make his way in New York, his career was suddenly advanced by a brilliant marraige. Genevieve Whitney was the only daughter of a distinguished man. Her marriage with young Burden was the subject of sharp comment at the time. It was said that she had been brutally jilted by her cousin, Rutland Whitney, and that she married this unknown man from the West out of bravado. She was a restless, headstrong girl, even then, who liked to astonish her friends. Later, when I knew her, she was always doing something unexpected. She gave one of her town houses for a Suffrage head-quarters, produced one of her own plays at the Princess Theater, was arrested for picketing during a garment-makers\u0026rsquo; strike, etc. I am never able to believe that she has much feeling for the causes to which she lends her name and her fleeting interest. She is handsom, energetic,\nx Next Page →\n","id":2,"length":240,"title":"x","type":"introduction","url":"//localhost:1313/introduction/x/"},{"content":"executive, but to me she seems unimpressionable and temperamentally incapable of enthusiasm. Her husband\u0026rsquo;s quiet tastes irritate her, I think, and she finds it worth while to play the patroness to a group of young poets and painters of advanced ideas and mediocre ability. She has her own fortune and lives her own life. For some reason, she wishes to remain Mrs. James Burden.\nAs for Jim, no disappointments have been severe enough to chill his naturally romantic and ardent disposition. This disposition, though it often made him seem ver funny when he was a boy, has been one of the strongest elements in his success. He loves with a personal passion the great counry through which his railway runs and branches. His faith in it and his knowledge of it have played an important part in its development. He is always able to raise capital for new enterprises in Wyoming or Montana, and has helped young men out there to do remarkable things in mines and timber and oil. If a young man with an idea can get Jim Burden\u0026rsquo;s attention, can manage to accompany him when he goes off into the wilds hunting for lost parks or exploring new canyons, then the money which means action is usually forthcoming. Jim is still able to lose himself in those big Western dreams.

He never seems to me to grow older. His fresh color and sandy hair and quick-changing blue eyes are those of a young man, and his sympathetic, solicitous interest in women is as youthful as it is Western and American.\nDuring that burning day when we were crossing Iowa, our talk kept returning to a central figure, a Bohemian girl whom we had known long ago and whom both of us admired. More than any other person we remembered, this girl seemed to mean to us the country, the conditions, the whole nature of our childhood. To speak her name was to call up pictures of people and places, to set a quiet drama going in one\u0026rsquo;s brain. I had lost sight of her altogether, but Jim had found her again after long years, had renewed a friendship that meant a great deal to him, and out of his busy life had set apart time enough to enjoy that friendship. His mind was full of her that day. He made me see her again, feel her presence, revived all my old affection for her.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t see,\u0026rdquo; he said impetuously, \u0026ldquo;why you have never written anything about Ántonia.\u0026rdquo;\nI told him I had always felt that other people — he himself, for one — knew her much better than I.

We might, in this way, get a picture of her.\nHe rumpled his hair with a quick, excited gesture, which with him often announces a new determination, and I could see that my suggestion took hold of him. \u0026ldquo;Maybe I will, maybe I will!\u0026rdquo; he declared. He stared out of the window for a few moments, and when he turned to me again his eyes had the sudden clearness that comes from something the mind itself sees. \u0026ldquo;Of course,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;I should have to do it in a direct way, and say a great deal about myself. It\u0026rsquo;s through myself that I knew and felt her, and I\u0026rsquo;ve had no practice in any other form of presentation.\u0026rdquo;\nI told him that how he knew her and felt her was exactly what I most wanted to know about Ántonia. He had had opportunities that I, as a little girl who watched her come and go, had not.\n\nMonths afterward Jim Burden arrived at my apartment one stormy winter afternoon, with a bulging legal portfolio shelter under his fur overcoat. He brought it into the sitting-room with him and tapped it with some pride as he stood warming his hands.\n\u0026ldquo;I finished it last night — the thing about Ántonia,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Now, what about yours?\u0026rdquo;\nxiii Next Page →\n","id":5,"length":230,"title":"xiii","type":"introduction","url":"//localhost:1313/introduction/xiii/"},{"content":"I had to confess that mine had not gone eyond a few straggling notes.\n\u0026ldquo;Notes?

I was ten years old then; I had lost both my father and mother within a year, and my Virginia relatives were sending me out to my grandparents, who lived in Nebraska. I traveled in the care of a mountain boy, Jake Marpole, one of the \u0026ldquo;hands\u0026rdquo; on my father\u0026rsquo;s old farm under the Blue Ridge, who was now going West to work for my grandfather.

Beyond Chicago we were under the protection of a friendly passenger conductor, who knew all about the country to which we were going and gave us a great deal of advice in exchange for our confidence. He seemed to us an experienced and worldly man who had been almost everywhere; in his conversation he threw out lightly the names of distant States and cities. He wore the rings and pins and badges of different fraternal orders to which he belonged. Even his cuff-buttons were engraved with heiroglyphics, and he was more inscribed than an Egyptian obelisk. Once when he sat down to chat, he told us that in the immigrant car ahead there was a family from \u0026ldquo;across the water\u0026rdquo; whose destination was the same as ours.\n\u0026ldquo;They can\u0026rsquo;t any of them speak English, except one little girl, and all she can say is \u0026lsquo;We go Black Hawk, Nebraska.\u0026rsquo; She\u0026rsquo;s not\n4 Next Page →\n","id":8,"length":209,"title":"4","type":"part one","url":"//localhost:1313/part-one/chapter-one/4/"},{"content":"much older than you, twelve or thirteen, maybe, and she \u0026rsquo;s bright as a new dollar.

Jake roused me and took me by the hand. We stumbled down from the train to a wooden siding, where men were running about with lanterns. I could n\u0026rsquo;t see any town, or even distant lights; we were surrounded by utter darkness. The engine was panting heavily after its long run.

I knew this must be the immigrant family the conductor had told us about. The woman wore a fringed shawl tied over her head, and she carried a little tin trunk in her arms, hugging it as if it were a baby. There was an old man, tall and stooped. Two half-grown boys and a girl stood holding oil-cloth bundles, and a little girl clung to her mother\u0026rsquo;s skirts. Presently a man with a lantern approached them and began to talk, shouting and exclaiming. I pricked up my ears, for it was positively the first time I had ever heard a foreign tongue.\nAnother lantern came along. A bantering voice called out: \u0026ldquo;Hello, are you Mr. Burden\u0026rsquo;s folks? If you are, it\u0026rsquo;s me you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. I \u0026rsquo;m Otto Fuchs.

He might have stepped out of the pages of \u0026ldquo;Jesse James.\u0026rdquo; He wore a sombrero hat, with a wide leather band and a bright buckle, and the ends of his mustache were twisted up stiffly, like little horns.

A long scar ran across one cheek and drew the corner of his mouth up in a sinister curl. The top of his left ear was gone, and his skin was brown as an Indian\u0026rsquo;s. Surely this was the face of a desperado. As he walked about the platform in his high-heeled boots, looking for our trunks, I saw that he was a rather slight man, quick and wiry, and light on his feet. He told us we had a long night drive ahead of us, and had better be on the hike. He led us to a hitching-bar where two farm wagons were tied, and I saw the foreign family crowding into one of them. The other was for us. Jake got into the front seat with Otto Fuchs, and I rode on the straw in the bottom of the wagon-box, covered up with a buffalo hide. The immigrants rumbled off into the empty darkness, and we followed them.\nI tried to go to sleep, but the jolting made me bite my tongue, and I soon began to ache all over. When the straw settled down I had a hard bed. Cautiously I slipped from under the buffalo hide, got up on my knees and peered over the side of the wagon. There seemed to be nothing to see; no fences, no creeks or trees, no hills or fields.

There was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made. No, there was nothing but land — slightly undulating, I knew, because often our wheels ground against the brake as we went down into a hollow and lurched up again on the other side. I had the feeling that the world was left behind, that we had got over the edge of it, and were outside man\u0026rsquo;s jurisdiction. I had never before looked up at the sky when there was not a familiar mountain ridge against it. But this was the complete dome of heaven, all there was of it. I did not believe that my dead father and mother were watching me from up there; they would still be looking for me at the sheep-fold down by the creek, or along the white road that led to the mountain pastures. I had left even their spirits behind me. The wagon jolted on, carrying me I knew not whither. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I was homesick. If we never arrived anywhere, it did not matter.
