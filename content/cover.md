Willa Cather's *My Ántonia* is as significant in 2018 as it was 100 years ago at its first publication.  It has inspired readers of all stripes to make the pilgrimage to Red Cloud, the small Nebraska town whose memory Cather drew upon in writing about Black Hawk.  It has inspired literary scholars to examine not only the text of the novel, but also Cather's relationships with the people of Red Cloud who, in some way, inspired the characters of *My Ántonia*.

In this online project, we invite readers from all backgrounds to participate in annotating the text of *My Ántonia.* Many of the themes are as relevant today as they were during Cather's lifetime, and we invite annotations exploring such connects alongside those that examine literary and historical context for the novel.

To take part in this project, visit the [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) website and set up an account.  Then return to this site and begin exploring the novel and its annotations so far, and feel free to make additions of your own!
