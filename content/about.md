## <div style="text-align: center">Annotating *Ántonia* at 100</div>

The goal of this project is to create an enriched experience for readers of *My Ántonia*, whether they are reading it for the first time or the hundredth.

To accomplish these goals, this project's coordinators — drawn from a range of specialty fields — have focused on using annotation, an age-old scholarly practice, as a form of public engagement.  These annotations are created *in public*, intended *for* the public, and *invite contributions* from general readers as well as scholars of literature and Cather more specifically.

This site uses the text of *My Ántonia*'s first edition, preserving the original pagination of the text.  It is built in [Quire](http://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/platforms-tools.html), an open-source multi-format publication platform by Getty.  To view annotations, readers should use [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is), an open-source web annotation tool built on principles of openness, collaboration, and shared knowledge.
